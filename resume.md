## Professional Experience

**Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center**\
*Data Scientist*\
*New York, NY. June 2021 (Current)*

- Develop Machine Learning infrastructure to serve random forest regression predictions into operating room scheduling infrastructure to realize operating room scheduling accuracy improvement of 17%.
- Write design specifications to orchestrate team of 6 developers across 4 teams, including serialization specification for FHIR health data standard.
- Unify API for model training and feature caching, eliminating feature inconsistency and improving online model performance by 40%. Improved time-to-prediction by 83% and reliability by 4%

*Data Engineer / Data Analyst*\
*Sept 2019 -- June 2021*

- Led development for company-wide Python and R packages to interface with vendor APIs to help analysts to
perform I/O operations, notably with Microsoft Teams via MS Graph API. Managed changes from 6 developers.
- Deployed infrastructure within 2 days for what is now most-viewed Covid-19 web app in hospital (>4000 views). Project helped leadership know when to re-open operating rooms while protecting ICU utilization.
- Designed separation of front and back end for Covid-19 web app, allowing team to work in parallel. Built back end in R, bash, and SQL consisting of 4 web scrapes, 2 database ETLs, and 3 web API data feeds

**Precision Xtract**\
*Analyst*\
*Stamford, CT. Sept 2018 -- Sept 2019*
- Introduced web scraping framework to generate
physician-hospital crosswalk.

## Academic Experience

**Courses**
- Deep Learning Systems
- Distributed Systems
- Algorithms
- Operating Systems
- Machine Learning Theory
- Natural Language Processing

**Teaching Assistant, Artificial Intelligence** *Fall 2021*

- Taught ML concepts (SVMs, random forests) and search algorithms (heuristic, adversarial, backtracking) in Python during weekly office hours to CS upperclassmen and graduate students. 
- Graded student code and conceptual responses. Developed Python reference code solutions.

**Distributed Key Value Database (Go)** \
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yckrascc" target="_blank">GitHub Link</a>

-   Designed a distributed key-value storage database that includes both
    sharded load balancing and shard replication.

-   Used Paxos consensus algorithm to implement replicated write-ahead
    log to ensure serializable consistency.

**From-Scratch Neural Network Image Reconstruction (Python)** \
<a href="https://git.io/JcvP8" target="_blank">GitHub Link</a>

-   Wrote vectorized feed-forward neural network in Numpy to reconstruct
    images, using Adaptive Momentum (Adam) gradient descent to train
    weight and bias parameters.
