<h1>Hi! My name is Joe.</h1>
<main>
    <div class="blurb">
        <p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer working to integrate predictive systems into application infrastructure. I completed my MS in Computer Science at <a href ="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a> in July 2022, and I develop ML infrastructure for the #2 top cancer hospital in the US, <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/" target="_blank">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>.</p>
        <p>At work, I do "full stack" machine learning, from exploratory data analysis to modeling to system integration to drift monitoring. My current project involves integrating a random forest model into the Electronic Medical Record system in near-real-time using an event-driven architecture leveraging online predictions. The purpose: to help my hospital run smoothly and improve the standard of care for vulnerable patients.</p>
        <p>At Columbia, I studied both machine learning and systems programming. In my experience, modeling data alone can prove opportunity, but building a fully-integrated predictive application is where the impact happens. A model in a Jupyter Notebook isn't going to serve itself!</p>
        <p>I also have a passion for teaching CS concepts. I was a Teaching Assistant for Columbia's Artificial Intelligence class taught by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ansaf/" target="_blank">Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi</a>, which teaches graph search algorithms and basics of Machine Learning in Python to upperclassmen and masters students.</p>
