    <div class="blurb">
        <p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in productionizing AI systems into healthcare infrastructure. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/roche-flatiron-health-1-9b">Flatiron Health</a>, where I productionize NLP models (entity extraction, summarization, etc) to run across millions of patients and billions of individual medical documents.</p>
        <p>I have spent my entire professional life working in healthcare. Prior to Flatiron Health, I developed ML infrastructure for the #2 top cancer hospital in the US, <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find/memorialsloankettering" target="_blank">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>, where I performed "full stack" machine learning to operationalize ML models for Department of Surgery, performing exploratory data analysis, modeling, Epic system integration (FHIR), and post-deployment QA.</p>
        <p>I recieved a MS in Computer Science, focusing on Deep Learning, at Columbia and my BSE from Princeton in Biological Engineering.</p>
