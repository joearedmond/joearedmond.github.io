# Professional Experience

**Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center** **New York, NY**\
*Data Scientist* *June 2021 (Current)*

-   Built near-real-time pipeline to serve random forest regression
    predictions into Electronic Health Record using R (plumber), Linux,
    and IBM DB2 to realize operating room scheduling accuracy
    improvement of 17%.

-   Led adaptation of HL7 FHIR health data standard for 6 developers
    across 4 teams for above application to ensure robust pipeline
    integration. Wrote serialization specification to integrate model
    accurately.

-   Added in-memory caching and error recovery logic to application,
    improving time-to-prediction by 83% and reliability by 4%. Designed
    telemetry system to monitor system performance.

-   Led development for company-wide R package interfacing with vendor
    APIs to help analysts to perform I/O operations, notably with
    Microsoft Teams via MS Graph API. Managed issues and changes from 6
    developers.

*Data Analyst* *Sept 2019 -- June 2021*

-   Deployed infrastructure within 2 days for what is now most-viewed
    Covid-19 dashboard in hospital (\>4000 views). Project helped
    leadership know when to re-open operating rooms while protecting ICU
    utilization.

-   Designed separation of front and back end for Covid-19 dashboard,
    allowing team to work in parallel. Built back end in R, bash, and
    SQL consisting of 4 web scrapes, 2 database ETLs, and 3 web API data
    feeds.

**Precision Xtract** **Stamford, CT**\
*Analyst:* Introduced web scraping framework to generate
physician-hospital crosswalk. *Sept 2018 -- Sept 2019*

# Academic Experience

**Courses** Deep Learning Systems, Distributed Systems, Algorithms, OS,
Machine Learning Theory\
**Teaching Assistant, Artificial Intelligence** *Fall 2021*

-   Hosted office hours and graded student work for masters-level survey
    course, including search (heuristic, adversarial, backtracking) and
    machine learning (SVMs, decision trees). Student implementations in
    Python.

**Distributed Key Value Database (Go)** <https://tinyurl.com/yckrascc>

-   Designed a distributed key-value storage database that includes both
    sharded load balancing and shard replication.

-   Used Paxos consensus algorithm to implement replicated write-ahead
    log to ensure serializable consistency.

**From-Scratch Neural Network Image Reconstruction (Python)**
<https://git.io/JcvP8>

-   Wrote vectorized feed-forward neural network in Numpy to reconstruct
    images, using Adaptive Momentum (Adam) gradient descent to train
    weight and bias parameters.
