# ML is good when it is useful.

I am a graduating Masters student in Computer Science at Columbia University studying machine learning and systems programming. Integrating machine learning into production applications gets me going. A model in a Juptyer Notebook isn't going to serve itself!

I am also a Data Scientist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, a top cancer hospital, where do "full stack" machine learning, from exploratory data analysis to modelling to system integration. My current project involves integrating a random forest model into the Electronic Medical Record system in near-real-time using an event-driven architecture.

I was a Teaching Assistant for Columbia's Artificial Intelligence class taught by [Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ansaf/), which teaches graph search algorithms and basics of Machine Learning in Python to advanced undergraduates and masters students.

I have a passion for writing software that makes a difference. I believe in the power of well-designed applications to improve the clinical environment, instead of slowing it down. I know that useful machine learning depends on sturdy infrastructure, so I focus my efforts on the union of data engineering and modeling.
