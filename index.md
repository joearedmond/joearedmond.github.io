I am a Computer Science MS student at Columbia University studying machine learning and systems programming. In my experience as a Data Scientist at a major cancer hospital, modeling data alone can prove opportunity, but integrating a model with an application is where the impact happens. A model in a Juptyer Notebook isn't going to serve itself!

At work, I do "full stack" machine learning, from exploratory data analysis to modeling to system integration to drift monitoring. My current project involves integrating a random forest model into the Electronic Medical Record system in near-real-time using an event-driven architecture.

As a graduate student, I was a Teaching Assistant for Columbia's Artificial Intelligence class taught by [Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ansaf/), which teaches graph search algorithms and basics of Machine Learning in Python to advanced undergraduates and masters students.
